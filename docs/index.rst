Welcome to the Nunn Lab Proteomics Analysis Documentation!
==========================================================

These pages provide instructions for processing different kinds of proteomics data using fully-automated workflows on the Genome Sciences (GS) cluster. These workflows, written in Nextflow, automate the entire process--starting with the raw mass spectrometer data and ending with data visualization in tools like Limelight or Skyline.
